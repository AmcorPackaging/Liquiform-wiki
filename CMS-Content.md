## Content

Each **ContentType** has **Content**, organized by **Entries**. 

For example, the Content Type `headerContent` has this list of entries:

![headerContent Entries](https://github.com/AmcorPackaging/LiquiForm/wiki/images/headerContentEntries.png)

This **Entries** contains the data introduced by the _Editors_ to be rendered in our app.
Each **Entry** contains one or more **fields**, depending on its configuration.

In the example the example the **Entry** belongs to the **ContentType "headerContent"**, containing 4 **fields**:
 - page: dropdown menu to choose what page it will be rendered
 - headerTitle: Text field, that will be the Title of the header
 - headerContent: Text field, that will be the Content below the Title
