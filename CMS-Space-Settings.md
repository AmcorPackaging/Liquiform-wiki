## Space Settings

### General

### Locales

Every Space has its own set of locales, and each locale is uniquely identified by its ISO code (e.g., en-US or de-AT). There's always one default locale defined when you create a space, shown by default in the Contentful web app and used for Content Delivery API queries that do not request a specific locale.

### Roles

Creating a new role:

Select "Roles" from the "Settings" menu at the top of the screen (this menu is only available to space administrators). Find a role in the list that is similar to the role you'd like to create, click "â€¦", and select "Duplicate role". On this new screen you can customize the rules that will apply to users who are assigned this role.

### Webhooks

Webhooks extend integration possibilities by notifying you, another person or system when resources have changed by calling a pre-configured HTTP endpoint.

### Extensions

The UI Extensions SDK allows you to customize and extend the functionality of the Contentful Web App's entry editor. The editor itself is a container for components that enable editors to manipulate the content stored in content fields. Extensions can be simple user interface controls, such as a dropdown, or more complex micro web applications such as our Markdown editor. Extensions are decoupled entities from field types, and you can reuse them, for example using a dropdown to edit number or text fields. Custom extensions that you create are rendered inside a secure iframe.
