## Zapier

### Reporting

We use [Zapier](https://zapier.com) to create automated reports of the `commits` and `Pull Requests` (`PRs`) that are updated on the [Github](./Github) repository.

It integrates the [LiquiForm](https://github.com/AmcorPackaging/LiquiForm) repository with an [Google Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1D_C0pTPRHie98nG6XFoT1q9WzJNesUyzsY2H-g8z4gQ/edit?usp=sharing), shared in the Docs Folder on [Basecamp](./Basecamp)

This "Zap" should be created at the same time that a new repository is created, in order to track all the `commits`.
